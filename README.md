## Before Installation

- This extension is made and tested on Chrome (may work in Firefox but no guarantee). Support for other browsers is not yet tested.

- The extension is not listed on the Chrome Web Store because I intended it to be a personal project. I assure you that this extension has no malware nor does it steal any data from your device.


## Installation

### 1. Download latest release
Click on the latest release and then click on the first .zip file to download it.

### Done!
Click the extension icon in the top right corner and click the extension to get started! Keep in mind that you need to keep developer mode on for the extension to run. Developer mode enables chrome to install and run extensions directly from your machine instead of the chrome web store.
